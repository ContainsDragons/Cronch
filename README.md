### Cronch is a sprite sheet creator inspired by [crunch](https://github.com/ChevyRay/crunch) (I actually made it because I could not get it working)

## Usage:

1: Choose the files you want to add by clicking `add images`

2: Select your files and press `ok`

3: To remove the files select the name of the file and click the `remove image` button

4: Set the `rows` and `columns` (rows are how many images up, columns are how many images to the side)

5: Click `Cronch`

6: Tweak the rows and columns untill all the images how up correctly

7: Click `Save`

8: Select your folder and press `ok`

9: The spritesheet is created as `SpriteSheet.png`

10: Your done! :D

## Notes:

All images have to be the same size

## Upcoming Features:

All images can bu differnt sizes

Sprite rotation

Animation viewer

Better algorithm for packing sprites

# If used in a project, credit is not needed but would be nice :)
